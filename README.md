# üß† OOP-FastAPI Backend

## üìå Overview

`oop-fastapi-backend` is a scalable, modular, and secure **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** backend system built using **FastAPI**. Designed with **SOLID** principles, this project demonstrates advanced backend architecture tailored for **maintainability**, **testability**, and **real-world production** use cases.  

Whether you're a beginner trying to understand FastAPI through structure or a professional looking for reusable OOP architecture ‚Äî this repo serves both purposes.


> üß© **Note:**

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to **teach and implement FastAPI the right way** using clean OOP patterns. It demonstrates:

- OOP design in Python backend development
- SOLID principles in FastAPI applications
- Real-world features like authentication, email sending, JWT tokens, and middleware
- A clean, layered, and maintainable project structure
- A powerful **path aliasing system** for modular architecture
- Deep exploration of OOP concepts
- Practical implementation of design patterns and system design

## üöÄ You‚Äôll Learn:

### üîπ 1. How to Isolate Concerns with Services and Controllers
- Understand the separation of business logic (`Services`) from HTTP handling (`Controllers`) to write clean, maintainable code.
- Learn how each service class handles specific business responsibilities while controllers remain thin and focused on request/response mapping.

### üîπ 2. How to Define and Use DTOs with Pydantic
- Design clear data contracts using **Pydantic** models (also called DTOs ‚Äì Data Transfer Objects).
- Validate incoming and outgoing data effectively.
- Structure schemas for `Create`, `Update`, and `Read` operations following SOLID principles.

### üîπ 3. How to Use ODMantic with MongoDB
- Leverage **ODMantic**, an async ODM built on Pydantic, to define MongoDB models and interact with the database.
- Use features like `find_one`, `find`, and `model_validate_doc()` to query MongoDB asynchronously with ease.
- Learn how to structure and validate data at the model level.

### üîπ 4. How to Implement Token Authentication Securely
- Master authentication flows with **OAuth2PasswordBearer** and JWTs.
- Secure endpoints using access tokens and refresh tokens.
- Refresh expired tokens automatically using middleware.
- Protect routes with role-based and permission-based access control.
- Giving roles while creating users with *FACTORY* design pattern

### üîπ 5. How to Build and Send Real Emails with Templates
- Use **Jinja2** templating and **emails** or **smtplib** to craft professional HTML emails.
- Implement the **Command Behavioral Design Pattern** for reusable email commands (e.g., OTP, email verification).
- Configure SMTP settings and abstract email logic from controllers and services.

### üîπ 6. How to Structure a Production-Grade FastAPI App
- Organize your FastAPI app using industry-standard folder structure with OOP principles.
- Apply **SOLID principles** (especially Single Responsibility & Dependency Inversion) for better scalability.
- Implement configuration management using a `config.py` or `.env` files with validation.

### üîπ 7. How to Manage Dependencies Cleanly with FastAPI
- Use `Depends()` to inject services, authenticated user objects, or parsed headers.
- Centralize shared logic (like database or authentication) with dependency injection.

### üîπ 8. How to Handle Errors and Exceptions Gracefully
- Use try-except blocks to catch and manage runtime errors.
- Raise **FastAPI HTTPException** with proper status codes and messages.
- Create global exception handlers for consistent API error responses.

### üîπ 9. How to Version Your API
- Implement **API versioning** (e.g., `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`) to support backward compatibility and better maintainability.

### üîπ 10. How to Use Middleware for Auth and Header Management
- Build middleware that automatically:
  - Deserializes and attaches user info from access tokens.
  - Updates headers like `Authorization` or custom ones (`x-refresh`) in every request.

### üîπ 11. How to Secure User Passwords and JWTs
- Hash and verify passwords using **Passlib** (`bcrypt` , `argon2` hashing scheme).
- Sign and verify JWT tokens securely using **Python-JOSE**.
- Manage token expiry and refresh lifecycle effectively.

### üîπ 12. How to Design Singleton Database Connection
- Use the **Singleton Design Pattern** to maintain a single database engine instance across your app.
- Avoid duplicate connections and improve performance in production.

## üß™ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Routes & Class-Based Views
All routes are defined inside classes and registered through custom routers for modularity.

### ‚úÖ Config Management
All config values (DB URI, secret keys, SMTP credentials) are read from `.env` via `pydantic.BaseSettings`.

MongoDB connection via ODMantic is implemented using a singleton pattern to avoid redundant connections.

### ‚úÖ Interfaces
All controllers and routes implement interfaces to enforce contracts and reusability.

MongoDB models are defined using ODMantic, which combines `pydantic` with MongoDB modeling.

### ‚úÖ Email Sending with Templating
- Command Design Pattern used to send emails
- `jinja2` used to render OTP, verification emails
- `emails` package used to send via SMTP

### ‚úÖ Authentication
- Secure login using **OAuth2PasswordBearer**
- **JWT tokens** signed/verified using `python-jose`
- Token middleware injects user data into request context
- Passwords are hashed using **`passlib[bcrypt]`**

### ‚úÖ Exception Handling
- Business logic is wrapped in `try/except`
- Custom FastAPI exceptions raised with meaningful messages

### ‚úÖ Middleware
- Serializes JWT payloads
- Validates and embeds user in request
- Embeds headers like tokens automatically

### ‚úÖ API Versioning
Support for clean versioning via prefixes like `/api/v1`, enabling scalable API evolution
